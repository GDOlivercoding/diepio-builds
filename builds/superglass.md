#### NOTE: that this build doesn't have an actual name, but this one fits pretty well

---

as hinted by its name, this is super glass, we are pumping all of our upgrades into attack upgrades, so much that we have all of them completely maxed, making us 5 movement speed

this build is specially designed for **battleship**, if you want to know why, i recommend looking into battleship in the tanks directory

there really isnt another tank which would need to go this diehard on the bullet stats
