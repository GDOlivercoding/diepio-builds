(short for **ssp**)

sea serpent build consists of maximum damage, movement speed, and some health, usually considered a very passive build due to its low bullet speed

you'll usually see this build on **fighter**
because due to fighter's natural high movement speed, it doesn't suffer as much passivity, using ssp on fighter is usually with the intent to kill **overlords**, with the strategy of rushing in, with the extra health that helps, note that fighter with sea serpent build usually fails to skilled glass fighters

you may also use this build with **pentashot** or **spreadshot**, as a way to protect another tank going with you (such as an overlord)
