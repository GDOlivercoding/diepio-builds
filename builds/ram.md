this is the universal build for all rammers, we need to understand here, that ram is pretty bad in this game, though extremely fatal, it really fails to triangles with any tank, in ffa, you have no where to hide from triangle, and in tdms, you cant attack a massive crowd of people, since getting close enough is a challenge by itself

with that known, we should only use ram for the best tanks

the best rammer in the entire tank is **annihilator**, by far, even outshining smashers, due to extremely speedy recoil of its massive bullet, booster may come in second but this is already where it gets pretty unplayable, next we have fighter and fighter with a ram build is completely unplayable

now with that in mind, the strategy is simple, use the recoil of your massive barel to push yourself towards your victims, usually ones with either low dps (damage per second), or whose defense is currently missing, such as overlord after repelling its drones

so use this build only with annihilator, but be warned, it is not going to be very good
