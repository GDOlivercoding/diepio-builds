---

usually used for droners which need both bullet speed and reload,
these tanks are: **battleship, factory, necromancer**

for factory and necromancer, this is their only real build

factory needs their bullets to be fast as it and its minion's bullets, necromancer needs reload as in the form of max drone count and battleship produces loads of mini drones

for battleship i recommend the [**super glass build**](.\superglass.md)

you might also use this with a destroyer tank, while gaining extra speed with the reload, being this vulnerable as a single bullet tank is no good

for destroyer i recommend the [**reload sea serpent **](.\reloadssp.jpg) build
