---

commonly refered to ass "glass", in diep.io, glass is anything without any health upgrades, as said, with this build, you have no health so you must be very careful

though vulnerable, extremely strong and decent, it is very playable and often the best choice

for example, for triangles, this build is probably the strongest, as long as you are able to avoid taking as much damage as possible

this is also a very decent build for any bullet spammers

instead of mentioning all usable tanks with this build, i am going to mention all *unusable tanks*:

    smashers - obviously they cant shoot or attack, except for auto smasher

    tanks that need max bullet speed, such as snipers (ranger), or droners (overlord, factory, necromancer)

    drones which dont need reload - literally just overlord

if you plan on playing a bullet spammer, either pick this build or the [**ssp**](./ssp.md) build
