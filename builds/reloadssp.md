for tanks that do not need reload, as simple as that, most commonly used by overlord, this is the most common and most used build for overlord, you might also want to used this using a destroyer tank, with the strategy of one booming a player and then using your health to escape potential dangers

overlord's reload is so high that it does not need any more reload, even with reload, there isnt much of a difference

**you may also try 1/2/2/-----** in for example ffa, when you have a little bit less health but 1 level of regen, though, nobody actually uses this, i did before becoming a little bit more skilled

you *may* attempt to use this with predator but i doubt it would be any good
